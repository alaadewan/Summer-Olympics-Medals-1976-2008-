# Summer Olympics Medals (1976-2008)

## Dataset

This dataset is a list of all the medal winners in the Summer Olympics from 1976 Montreal to 2008 Beijing. 
It includes each and every medal awarded within the period.
There are 15,316 records in the dataset with 11 features (city, year, sport, discipline, event, athlete, gender, country_code, country, eventgender, medal). Most variables are categorical in nature, the variable medal is
ordered factor variable with the following levels: (worst) ——> (best) Bronze, Silver, Gold.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a very strong positive relationship
in the participation of women through time. Men's participation in Olympics has 
slightly increase through years, but women really did it they have amazing 
level of increasing. They awarded medals in 2008 double the awarded in 1976.
It's was really a big shock that Egyptian women participation in Olympics is ZERO!!!!
Egyptian athletes were awarded only 1 medal in first 7 years then they reach
their peak in 2004 with 5 medals and recede back again in 2008 with only 1 medal.
Performance of athletes (Women/Men) playing Tennis is nearly the same.
Women started to Weightlifting in 2000, but they showed up with number of awarded medals
close to the men's awarded number.
Medals awarded in Weightlifting were constant from 1976 to 1996, until Weightlifting
sport showed up in 2000 to increase by one third.



Outside of the main variables of interest, I verified that USA contribution 
in 1980 is very low(which I'll investigate in deeper in the future). 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus mostly on the contribution of women/men athletes in Olympics
through years, comparing their awarded medals, their countries, and sports.
Afterwards, I introduce participants athletes from Egypt and Arab/Middle Eastern countries.
And explore some insights about tennis and weightlifting sports as personally I've interest of both.
